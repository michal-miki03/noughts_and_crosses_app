            The object of Noughts and Crosses is to get a winning line of three Noughts or three Crosses in either a
            horizontal, vertical or diagonal row.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Noughts and Crosses board is a square grid containing nine squares arranged in threes.
            The game is played by two people who either play as Noughts (Os) or Crosses ( Xs). They can either be drawn
            or objects resembling these two options can be used. In giant noughts and crosses for example, the two
            objects are the noughts and crosses themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
            The player with the Xs starts the game by positioning his X in a square. The player with the Os follows
            and
            both players take turns to move and occupy the squares of the grid trying to make a row of three and at
            the
            same time also block their opponent.
        </p>
        <p>
            In Noughts and Crosses the opening player has a slight advantage so it is advisable to alternate who
            starts
            first in order to keep the games fair. There is only a maximum of nine moves in any game so due to the
            speed
            and brevity of a Noughts and Crosses game, every turn counts.
            Despite the simple form of Noughts and Crosses it has been calculated that there are in excess of
            255,168
            possible layouts on the board. However it is a very simple game to play and because of this Noughts and
            Crosses is a very popular game for children. The giant noughts and crosses board is particularly fun to
            use,
            and especially for children.
